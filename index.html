                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p><strong>HTML</strong> &#40;HyperText Markup Language&#41; is the most basic building block of the
                        Web. It
                        defines
                        the
                        meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to
                        describe a web page's appearance/presentation &#40;CSS&#41; or functionality/behavior
                        &#40;JavaScript&#41;.</p>
                    <p>"HyperText" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website
                        or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the
                        Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in
                        the World Wide Web.</p>
                    <p>HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser. HTML
                        markup includes special "elements" such as &#60;hea&#62;, &#60;title&#62;, &#60;body&#62;,
                        &#60;header&#62;, &#60;footer&#62;, &#60;article&#62;, &#60;section&#62;, &#60;p&#62;,
                        &#60;div&#62;,
                        &#60;span&#62;, &#60;img&#62;, &#60;aside&#62;, &#60;audi&#62;,
                        &#60;canvas&#62;, &#60;datalist&#62;, &#60;details&#62;, &#60;embed&#62;, &#60;nav&#62;,
                        &#60;output&#62;,
                        &#60;progress&#62;, &#60;video&#62; and many others.</p>
                    <p>Tags in HTML are case insensitive. That is, they can be written in
                        uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture. Example &#60;title&#62; tag can be written
                        as &#60;Title&#62;,&#60;TITLE&#62; or in any other way.</p>

                    <h3>Begginer's tutorials</h3>
                    <p>Our HTML Learning Area features multiple modules that teach HTML from the ground up — no previous
                        knowledge required.</p>

                    <h4>Introduction to HTML</h4>
                    <p>This module sets the stage, getting you used to important concepts and syntax such as looking at
                        applying HTML to text, how to create hyperlinks, and how to use HTML to structure a web page.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Multimedia and embedding</h4>
                    <p>This module explores how to use HTML to include multimedia in your web pages, including the
                        different ways that images can be included, and how to embed video, audio, and even entire other
                        webpages.</p>
                    <h4>HTML tables</h4>
                    <p>Representing tabular data on a webpage in an understandable, accessible way can be a challenge.
                        This module covers basic table markup, along with more complex features such as implementing
                        captions and summaries.</p>
                    <h4>HTML forms</h4>
                    <p>Forms are a very important part of the Web — these provide much of the functionality you need for
                        interacting with websites, e.g. registering and logging in, sending feedback, buying products,
                        and more. This module gets you started with creating the client-side/front-end parts of forms.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Use HTML to solve common problems</h4>
                    <p>Provides links to sections of content explaining how to use HTML to solve very common problems
                        when creating a web page: dealing with titles, adding images or videos, emphasizing content,
                        creating a basic form, etc.</p>

                    <h3>Advanced topics</h3>
                    <h4>CORS anabled image</h4>
                    <p>The crossorigin attribute, in combination with an appropriate CORS header, allows images defined
                        by the &#60;img&#62; element to be loaded from foreign origins and used in a &#60;canvas&#62;
                        element as if they were being loaded from the current origin.</p>
                    <h4>CORS setting attributes</h4>
                    <p>Some HTML elements that provide support for CORS, such as &#60;img&#62; or &#60;video&#62;, have
                        a crossorigin attribute &#40;crossOrigin property&#41;, which lets you configure the CORS
                        requests for the element's fetched data.</p>
                    <h4>Focus management in HTML</h4>
                    <p>The activeElement DOM attribute and the hasFocus&#40;&#41; DOM method help you track and control
                        a user's interactions with elements on a web page.</p>
                    <h4>Using the aplication cache</h4>
                    <p>Application caching lets web-based applications run offline. You can use the Application Cache
                        &#40;AppCache&#41; interface to specify resources that the browser should cache and make
                        available to offline users. Applications that are cached load and work correctly even if users
                        click the refresh button when they are offline.</p>
                    <h4>Preloading content with rel="preload"</h4>
                    The preload value of the &#60;link&#62; element's rel attribute allows you to write declarative
                    fetch requests in your HTML &#60;head&#62;, specifying resources that your pages will need very soon
                    after loading, which you therefore want to start preloading early in the lifecycle of a page load,
                    before the browser's main rendering machinery kicks in. This ensures that they are made available
                    earlier and are less likely to block the page's first render, leading to performance improvements.
                    This article provides a basic guide to how preload works.

                    <h3>References</h3>
                    <h4>HTML reference</h4>
                    <p>HTML consists of elements, each of which may be modified by some number of attributes. HTML
                        documents are connected to each other with links.</p>
                    <h4>HTML element reference</h4>
                    <p>Browse a list of all HTML elements.</p>
                    <h4>HTML attribute reference</h4>
                    <p>Elements in HTML have attributes. These are additional values that configure the elements or
                        adjust their behavior in various ways.</p>
                    <h4>Global attributes</h4>
                    <p>Global attributes may be specified on all HTML elements, even those not specified in the
                        standard. This means that any non-standard elements must still permit these attributes, even
                        though those elements make the document HTML5-noncompliant.</p>
                    <h4>Inline elements and block-level elements</h4>
                    <p>HTML elements are usually "inline" or "block-level" elements. An inline element occupies only the
                        space bounded by the tags that define it. A block-level element occupies the entire space of its
                        parent element &#40;container&#41;, thereby creating a "block."</p>
                    <h4>Link types</h4>
                    <p>In HTML, various link types can be used to establish and define the relationship between two
                        documents. Link elements that types can be set on include &#60;a&#62;, &#60;area&#62; and
                        &#60;link&#62;.</p>
                    <h4>Media formats supported by the HTML audio and video elements</h4>
                    <p>The &#60;audio&#62; and &#60;video&#62; elements allow you to play audio and video media. These
                        elements provide a browser-native alternative to similar capabilities found in Adobe Flash and
                        other plug-ins.</p>
                    <h4>Kinds of HTML content</h4>
                    <p>HTML is comprised of several kinds of content, each of which is allowed to be used in certain
                        contexts and is disallowed in others. Similarly, each has a set of other content categories they
                        can contain and elements which can or can't be used in them. This is a guide to these
                        categories.</p>
                    <h4>Quirks mode and standards mode</h4>

                        of HTML documents can be colored and what CSS properties to use when doing so. Includes
